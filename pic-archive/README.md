# pic-archive

This project started off as dummy to practice my bash scripting skills and to 
checkout some features of the Java [JDBI library](http://jdbi.org). 


* this is a fun project! no proper coding, just GSD :)) *


# Prerequisites

- set up an HSQLDB server for url **jdbc:hsqldb:hsql://localhost/picArchive**
- run all the sql scripts from *src/main/resources/db*
- create a directory with read and write access at **/opt/p0gram3r/pic-archive**
